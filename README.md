MMA Fight Analysis

This project is an exploration of trends and patterns that occur across mixed martial arts bouts. The aim is to perform exploratory analysis and understand how different variables determine the probability of a specific outcome in a fight. The code for this project will be produced in Google Colab Jupyter Notebooks.


Installation Instructions
The project requires Python 3 and several Python packages. You can install them using the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Usage
The project will be divided into several steps:

Scraping: I will write a scraper that extracts event and fight information from the tapology.com website, and then parse it so I can use it for analysis.

Data Cleaning: Once the data is scraped, I will clean the data and perform any necessary data preprocessing to prepare it for analysis.

Exploratory Analysis: I will perform exploratory analysis to understand the data better, identifying trends, patterns and any outliers.

Feature Engineering: I will engineer the features to create predictive models and understand what the biggest factors are when it comes to a fighter's chance to win.

Model Development: I will develop and train predictive models to predict the outcome of different fights.
